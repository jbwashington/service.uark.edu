        <h2>Dream B.I.G.</h2>
        <p><b>Dream B.I.G. (Believing in Girls)</b> is a student-led girl empowerment mentoring initiative that serves 6th-grade to 12th-grade girls from the Marvell-Elaine School District of Phillips County in the Arkansas Delta. U of A students serve as
            mentors to engage with the high population of teenage girls living in conditions of poverty, abuse, neglect, high teenage pregnancy rates, high drop-out rates, and lack of motivation to pursue higher education.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>VAC Literacy Program is a student-led tutoring program with a goal to foster a love of reading and to improve literacy among grade school students. University of Arkansas volunteers commit to one semester of reading
            with a student for one hour a week. The program takes place at several local elementary schools’ afterschool programs as a part of the Boys and Girls Club of Fayetteville School Kids Connections program. University volunteers meet once a week
            during the semester to mentor a student from 3:30- 4:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday.</p>
