        <h2>Volunteer Action Center</h2>&nbsp;
        <p>The Volunteer Action Center is a student led board that is dedicated to active service in the community. Each year VAC provides meaningful service opportunities through events and ongoing projects that engage the university and Northwest Arkansas communities.

            Through VAC events sponsored in the 2013-2014 academic year, over 9376 students experienced 45,030 hours of service which made an economic impact of $1,015,427  in Northwest Arkansas.

            This academic year, by checking out the event calendar and logging their hours on volunteer.uark.edu, thousands of students are expected to become “VAC Volunteers” who make a difference each day while also earning opportunities for community recognition.</p>

        <h2>VAC Board Members</h2>&nbsp;
        <p>VAC consists of 40 dedicated students who make up the VAC board. Because the VAC board functions similarly to a nonprofit organization's board of directors, board members learn valuable skills such as volunteer recruitment, program coordination, fundraising and leadership. Collectively, VAC board members participate in more than 1,500 hours of service each year with an economic impact of $32,000.

            VAC board members meet weekly and serve as program for VAC sponsored programs. They are in good academic and judicial standing with a GPA of 2.25 or higher. If you would like to make an impact on your community while learning valuable skills, look for applications to join the VAC board in the spring.</p>
