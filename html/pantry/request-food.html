                    How to use Campus Food Pantry services

                    The very first time you access Full Circle; you will need to complete the "First Time" application.
                    Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari are currently the only browsers that are compatible with the application forms. We kindly ask you to not open the forms in Google Chrome, Opera or browsers other than what has been listed above.

                    You can utilize one of the following options below to submit your completed application form:
                </p>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <strong>
                        Option A
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        Send a PDF version of your application form to pantry@uark.edu. Here are some helpful guidelines to print the completed form as a PDF.
                        First locate the "print form" button and click on it, this will generate the computer's print options. In the Print option box, locate the "Name" field and click on the drop down arrow on the right to produce a list of printer options. Choose Adobe PDF, and click ok. This will print the form as a PDF with your completed information. After printing the form, locate it and send the PDF document as an email attachment. If you do not have the Adobe PDF print option, you can dowload Cute PDF here. This is a very useful free software that gives you the ability to print any document as a PDF. (Please do not try to save the form, as it will only save as a blank form). Once the completed form is received, your order will be processed and the Full Circle staff, will send you a notification email when the order is ready to be collected.
