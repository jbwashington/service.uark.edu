        <p>According to the Clinton Global Initiative University, "CGI U is a growing network of global young leaders. Through year-round partnership building, commitment development, and networking opportunities, CGI U builds awareness and generates support for the work of students, youth organizations, and the ever-growing CGI U community around the world. Throughout the year, participants report back to CGI U about commitment progress and connect via online communities and in-person meet-ups. Some commitment-makers continue their engagement by serving as CGI U Campus Representatives or Commitment Mentors." </p>
