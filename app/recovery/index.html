    <h2>What is Food Recovery?</h2>
    <p>It is estimated that colleges throw away 22 millions pounds of extra food every year. The purpose of Food Recovery is to recover this extra, wholesome food that would otherwise be wasted and donate it to hungry people. Razorback Food Recovery volunteers work with Chartwells Dining Service employees to recover the surplus food on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In the first phase of RFR, beginning in February 2014, volunteers recover food from retail locations in the Arkansas Union. Chartwells employees take the pre-packaged or bakery items to a designated location in the Union that holds a refrigerator for RFR to use. Each morning, volunteers go to the location to weigh and log the food and from there it is delivered to be donated either to Full Circle Campus Pantry or another community partner.</p>
<p>In the second phase of RFR, beginning in October 2014, volunteers recover food from Pomfret Dining Hall. In this process, volunteers recover food between lunch and dinner. Volunteers separate the large pans of surplus food into individual, freezable meals that can then be given out to community partner agencies.</p>
    <h2>Misson</h2>
    <p>The mission of the Razorback Recovery is to recover surplus food from university dining facilities for donation to local organizations that distribute food to those in need.</p>
